# Hi there! 👋 I'm Joana

I'm a **Software Developer** with a Master's degree in **Engineering Physics**. After completing my studies, I decided to pursue a career as a developer to stay updated with the technologies used in the industry. Currently, I work as a **frontend** developer, but I have a strong passion for understanding how everything works together.
